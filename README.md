### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![self](https://delport.ca/assets/content/self.jpg)

I'm a sysadmin and developer currently working in higher education.

When I'm not enjoying the outdoors with my wife and our [puppy](https://www.instagram.com/winter_shepherd/) you can usually find me breaking servers, building things in Elixir and Vue, or producing and editing podcasts for [SpecFM](https://spec.fm/).

Come chat with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_mikhailbot) or lets work on something together on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikhailbot)!

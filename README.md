### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![self](https://delport.ca/assets/content/self.jpg)

I'm a sysadmin and developer currently working in higher education.

When I'm not enjoying the outdoors with my wife, munchkin, and our [puppy](https://www.instagram.com/winter_shepherd/) you can usually find me breaking servers, melting plastic through copper nozzles, or building things with Elixir/Laravel/Swift.

Come chat with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_mikhailbot) or lets work on something together on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikhailbot)!
